The Western army held together after Shiloh because Johnston never rode into the kill zone. Four years of cumulative Confederate decisions have bent the war so far from its historical arc that Northern public opinion has reached a breaking point the Union never reached in the history we know. Grant is stalled. Sherman is bleeding. The autumn elections have shattered Lincoln's war coalition, and European powers are quietly drafting mediation proposals. Confederate armies still hold Virginia, the Valley is unbroken, and Richmond stands. Full independence is still on the table, but it is the hardest road. McClellan's candidacy, carried by a Democratic coalition with peace men inside it, offers something more plausible than recognized disunion: a restructured Federal Republic. Calhoun's Concurrent Majority meant that a numerical national majority should not govern a distinct sectional interest without that section's concurrent consent. The question is whether the South demands all or takes the next best thing.",

    hotspur: "Jackson is alive. Use him like Jackson: seize the heights before the Federals can breathe and turn Gettysburg into a battlefield panic instead of a static duel.",
    fox: "This is the value of Jackson surviving. Not romance, but tempo and coordination. Use him to keep Longstreet and the left hook aligned, not to feed another frontal myth.",

    hotspur: "Recognition is leverage, not peace. Keep the armies moving and force Washington to concede more than the present line.",
    fox: "The military object has been achieved. An armistice backed by Britain and France secures the army, the treasury, and independence before another campaign can spend them.",

  wilderness: {
    hotspur: "Grant has opened the Overland Campaign. Strike his columns in the thickets before his numbers and persistence turn every road south into a grinding siege.",
    fox: "The point is not one dramatic blow. Hold the Brock Road, force him to pay at each crossroads, and make the Overland Campaign an attritional ledger he cannot ignore.",

  atlanta_election_pressure: {
    hotspur: "Enough retreat. Replace Johnston, unleash Hood, and hit Sherman hard enough to prove Atlanta is not just another city to be traded away.",
    fox: "Johnston's retreats are not cowardice if they keep the army whole and Atlanta unconquered through the election season. Time is a weapon here.",
    wolf: "Atlanta is a Northern political test as much as a Georgia campaign. Stretch the timetable, feed peace agitation, and turn every week of delay into pressure on Lincoln."
  },
  fall_of_atlanta: {
    hotspur: "Reopen the Macon road at Jonesborough. Atlanta is still defensible if the army strikes before Sherman turns maneuver into a finished political victory.",
    fox: "Do not lose the army to save a city whose rails are already being cut. Evacuate in order and preserve the force that must fight after Atlanta.",
    wolf: "The calendar is the battlefield. Hold Atlanta only if the defense can deny Lincoln his September headline without trapping Hood inside the works."
  },
  black_confederate_debate: {
    hotspur: "If the state is dying, use every man who will fight. Force the issue now and stop pretending old formulas can still fill the line.",
    fox: "Do it where it can actually happen. Push willing states like Virginia and Louisiana to raise militia formations directly instead of wasting more months inside Congress.",
    wolf: "Tie enlistment to freedom terms and turn necessity into political leverage. The manpower question is now inseparable from the settlement the Confederacy can still claim to seek."

    hotspur: "Charge through the Berryville Canyon approach toward Sheridan's center! We must show them the spirit of the Valley is not yet broken!",

    wolf: "Spread rumors of Sheridan's defeat through copperhead networks to delay their advance and buy crucial time."
  },
  cedar_creek: {
    hotspur: "The dawn surprise is our last real chance to take Belle Grove, the wagons, and the grain back in one blow. Press before Sheridan turns panic into counterattack.",
    fox: "Secure the captured wagons first and make Belle Grove a line, not a trophy. The Valley must feed the army after the cheering stops.",
    wolf: "Shock them at dawn, publish the shock at once, and let organized seizure do the real work. A headline is useful, but a full commissary is survival."

  petersburg_siege: {
    hotspur: "Mahone is ready! Launch a desperate counter-attack into the Crater mine breach and trap their divisions inside the hole!",

  five_forks: {
    hotspur: "Lee ordered Five Forks held at all hazards. Stand on the crossroads and make Sheridan pay for the railroad.",
    fox: "The exposed left is the danger. Refuse it, keep reserves at Ford's Road, and save enough of Pickett's command to cover the evacuation.",
    wolf: "Disrupt Sheridan before Warren deploys, then withdraw while the corridor remains open. Hours and road access matter more than possession of one intersection."
  },
  richmond_evacuation: {
    hotspur: "Hold the capital long enough for the government to escape with dignity. A rearguard stand can still shape how this ending is remembered.",
    fox: "Leave now. Richmond is no longer worth the army. Preserve command, rations, and road order before Grant closes every route west.",
    wolf: "Make the evacuation look like continuity, not collapse. Dispatches to Europe and Northern peace men must show a government still able to bargain."

  greensboro_convention: {
    hotspur: "Reject all surrender terms! Urge the governors to continue resistance in the mountains with whatever men remain!",

    fox: "Grant's terms are honorable. Accept the parole, stack the arms, and let the men return home to rebuild their lives in peace.",

  southern_independence_1864: {
    hotspur: "This is the moment history does not have. Proclaim independence now. Force the world to decide. Nothing less than full recognition is worth four years of the dead.",
    fox: "Full independence is the right goal, but Europe will only ratify what the army already holds. Take the armistice while the lines are still ours and let sovereignty follow the facts on the ground.",
    wolf: "McClellan is the instrument, but Calhoun is the doctrine. Use the armistice to make him place a Concurrent Majority compact before Congress and the states. Ratification is not guaranteed, but it gives reunion a constitutional price instead of leaving the terms to armies alone."
